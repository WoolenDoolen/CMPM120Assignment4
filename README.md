## 3. Gameplay Description & How to Play

### High-level concept

You play as the city watchkeeper of a small mausoleum at the edge of a haunted city. Spirits and skeletons pour in from the streets, trying to reach the mausoleum. Your job is to survive several “shifts” (enemy waves) and keep the mausoleum standing using a magical ward attack and slow-field totems.

### Core loop

1. Walk to the glowing **Altar** and press **E** to start a shift.
2. Survive the incoming wave of enemies while keeping them away from the mausoleum.
3. After a wave ends, return to the Altar, press **E**, and choose one of three upgrades.
4. Repeat until you beat the final boss wave or the mausoleum (or you) are destroyed.

### Controls

- **Move** – **WASD** or **Arrow Keys**
- **Ward Attack (cone in front of you)** – **Space** or **Left Mouse Button**
- **Ward Totem (slow field at your feet)** – **Shift** or **Right Mouse Button**
- **Interact (Altar / upgrades)** – **E** when near the glowing Altar
- **Pause** – **Esc** (Esc again to unpause)
- **Restart** – **R** on Game Over or Win screens

### Goal

- Keep both **your HP** and the **mausoleum HP** above zero through all waves.
- Defeat the final boss wave to **“survive the night”** and reach the win screen.

The top HUD shows:

- Player HP
- Mausoleum HP
- Totem charges
- Current wave out of total waves

The center-top text is used for short guidance messages (wave start, upgrades, etc.).

## 4. Rubric Self-Evaluation (Project 4a Goals)

_Total: 10 points possible._

**Note about adapting the 4a rubric:**  
In Project 4a, our written rubric still talked about a stealth game with guards, vision cones, and hacking. For the final project we kept the same “night watchkeeper in a graveyard” fantasy, but shifted to a city wave-based defense game. To match what we actually built, we rewrote those goals into the five items below and scaled them to 10 points total.

1. **Clear core loop (defend mausoleum across multiple waves)** — **2 / 2 pts**  
   The game implements a full loop: start shift at the altar → fight a wave → choose an upgrade → next wave → final boss. The objective (protect the mausoleum until the final wave is beaten) is clear.

2. **Enemy variety and wave escalation** — **2 / 2 pts**  
   There are multiple enemy types (ghosts, skeletons, boss) with different speeds/health, and waves increase in difficulty and composition. A boss wave spawns at the end with extra skeletons to change the pacing.

3. **Player abilities and upgrade choices** — **3 / 3 pts**  
   The player has two tools (directional ward cone and slow-field totems) plus an upgrade system with three options: damage boost, move speed boost, or extra totem charge + faster recharge. After each cleared wave, an upgrade menu appears and pauses the world, so the player makes real build choices.

4. **Map readability and navigation (altar visibility, mausoleum focus)** — **2 / 2 pts**  
   The mausoleum and altar are both easy to spot: the altar has a pulsing highlight and “Altar” label, the mausoleum is marked in the center, and the HUD and title screen text both explain what to do. Players can quickly figure out where to go and what to protect.

5. **Feedback and juice (UI, flashes, overlays, audio)** — **1 / 1 pts**

   - Screen flashes when enemies or the boss are hit.
   - Slow-field totems appear as glowing circles.
   - There are overlays for Title, Pause, Upgrade menu, Game Over (red screen), and Win (blue screen).
   - Basic sound effects for ward, totem, and taking damage, plus looping background music.

   These match the “extra feedback/juice” goal from the original plan, so this earns full points I think.

## 5. Features to Notice & How to Unlock Them

### Altar highlight & flow

- The altar is marked with a **pulsing yellow circle** and a floating **“Altar”** label.
- Standing near it and pressing **E** is how you **start shifts** and **open the upgrade menu** after a wave.

### Ward cone attack

- The ward is a short-range arc in front of the player, with a visible cone effect.
- It hits only enemies within a certain angle and range from your current facing direction.
- This encourages you to position and face enemies instead of just spamming a full-screen attack.

### Ward totems (slow fields)

- **Shift** / **Right-click** places a totem at your feet (limited charges).
- Enemies inside the totem radius are slowed, making it easier to ward them away from the mausoleum.
- Totems expire after a set time but charges slowly regenerate; managing them is part of the strategy.

### Upgrades between waves

- After clearing a wave, you must return to the Altar and press **E**.
- An upgrade screen appears with three options:
  - - Ward damage
  - - Movement speed
  - - Max totem charge & faster recharge
- Upgrade choices stack, leading to different “builds” (for example, a slower, tankier zoner vs. a faster glass cannon).

### Final boss wave (unlock condition)

- After you complete the three regular waves, the **final boss wave** starts.
- The boss spawns along with extra skeletons.
- Defeating the boss triggers the **blue “Night Survived!” win screen**, with instructions to press **R** to replay.

### Game Over & Restart

- If your HP or the mausoleum’s HP reaches zero:
  - The screen tints red with a big **“GAME OVER”** overlay.
  - You can press **R** to restart the entire run.

### Pause screen

- Press **Esc** at any time to pause.
- The pause overlay shows controls and instructions. Press **Esc** again to resume.
